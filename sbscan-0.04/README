Welcome to SBSCan, a tool designed to assist system admins who can't be 
bothered doing anything by hand.  It could also help with some dial-up
users who need to know bout this kinda thing.



Currently this tool checks for the following...

 Anonymous FTP
 Unpassworded accounts
 Open Ports
 l33t Open Ports
 Entire Subnet Promisc Check
 Local machine promisc check
 Suspicious Files
 RHost files
 Sniffer check - Log files
 Suid programs in slash home
 Evidence of a Rootkit
 X Hosts allowed to connect
 Permissions on Vital directories.
 Log file permissions.
 NFS basic Check
 And it makes MD5 sums of common files...
